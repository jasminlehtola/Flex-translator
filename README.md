Add the title to the document and paste text or upload a PDF file. Then you can choose between manual translate and automatic translate. The Manual Translate option opens the editor, dividing the text into editable paragraphs. The Automatic Translate option allows you to translate the entire text quickly with a single click. After the translation is complete, you can return to the editor by selecting the Review button. The translated text remains saved, and you may revisit any paragraph to edit or retranslate it as needed.

### Manual Translate
You can edit the text by adding or removing content as needed. Click Save Changes before translating a paragraph to apply your changes. Edits are also saved automatically if you move your cursor outside the editing box. Click Toolbox to access AI options, including prompts and the dictionary. Both the original Finnish text and the translated text can be viewed by clicking their respective buttons. Use the numbered stepper buttons to navigate from one paragraph to another.

Two different translation options are generated. Select the one you prefer. Each translated paragraph is displayed under the Translated Text button, where the full text gradually builds up. When all paragraphs have been translated, click Finish Document to complete the process.

### Quick File Translation
Quick File Translation is for fast and accurate PDF translations. It processes the file with DeepL, outputs a complete DOCX file, and allows you to save it as a PDF. The layout, text, and images remain in their original positions. The file is automatically downloaded to your computer. This is the most effective option for translating PDF files. Note! No editing options are available, and nothing is saved to your account. Ensure that the translated document is saved to your computer.

### Translations-page
The Translations page stores all your previous translations. You can sort them by date or name, open them in the editor, assign them to groups, or delete them. Select a group to display all documents contained within it. To create a new group, click the Choose Group button and then select Create New Group.
